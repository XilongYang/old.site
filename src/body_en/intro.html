    <p>I'm an undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science of LNU.  </p>
    <p>I have been learning C++ for 3 years, and also have some experience with other mainstream programing languages such as Java„ÄÅPython and Shell. I'm trying to learn Haskell recently. </p>
    <p>In the last 3 years, I experienced about 20 Linux Distros, and chose Arch Linux as my main OS for a long time, but finally switched to Debian 11. By the way, I still hold my Windows for gaming.</p>
    <p>I once had a chance to be an ACMer. But in the end I gave up after only a few achievements. </p>
    <p>I maintain a <a href="https://github.com/XilongYang">github account</a> and <a href="https://blog.xilong.site">blog</a>. </p>
